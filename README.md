# MTG-Deck
Magic the Gathering deck builder
Program built in VS code with Python3 to pull data from json file and then turn that txt into deck options. 
Current build allows for 7 cards to initially be drawn out of 21. 
Further implementation will allow for entire deck to be built based off of random criteria and grouping.
